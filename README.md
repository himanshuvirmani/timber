![Timber](logo.png)

This is a logger with a small, extensible API which provides utility on top of Android's normal
`Log` class.

I copy this class into all the little apps I make. I'm tired of doing it. Now it's a library.

Behavior is added through `Tree` instances. You can install an instance by calling `Timber.plant`.
Installation of `Tree`s should be done as early as possible. The `onCreate` of your application is
the most logical choice.

The `DebugTree` implementation will automatically figure out from which class it's being called and
use that class name as its tag. Since the tags vary, it works really well when coupled with a log
reader like [Pidcat][1].

There are no `Tree` implementations installed by default because every time you log in production, a
puppy dies.


Usage
-----

Two easy steps:

 1. Install any `Tree` instances you want in the `onCreate` of your application class.
 2. Call `Timber`'s static methods everywhere throughout your app.

Check out the sample app in `timber-sample/` to see it in action.
